实验楼课程: [基于python的网络小爬虫](http://www.shiyanlou.com/courses/481) 相关代码

For windows:
go to command line mode, type "python meizi_thread.py". I assume you have already installed a python in your PC

For linux/Mac:
type "./meizi_thread.py" or "python meizi_thread.py"

Note that in meizi_thread.meizi(url, path): you have to pass a local filename to paramater "path"
